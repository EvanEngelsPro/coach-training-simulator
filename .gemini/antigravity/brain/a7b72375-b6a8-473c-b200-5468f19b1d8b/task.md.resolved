# Coach Training Simulator — Build Tasks

## Planning
- [x] Explore data structures ([sales-plan.json](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/sales-plan.json), [meeting-details.json](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/meeting-details.json))
- [x] Understand the README vision (passive feedback → active training)
- [x] Write implementation plan and get user approval

## Execution — Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Vite + vanilla JS project
- [x] Set up design system (CSS variables, Inter font, dark theme)
- [x] Set up project structure (modules, components, services, server)

## Execution — Core Modules
- [x] [planLoader.js](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/src/modules/planLoader.js) — parse and structure markers
- [x] [meetingAnalyzer.js](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/src/modules/meetingAnalyzer.js) — extract performance gaps, missed/weak markers
- [x] [trainingEngine.js](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/src/modules/trainingEngine.js) — orchestrate simulation session flow
- [x] [evaluator.js](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/src/modules/evaluator.js) — score user responses per marker + prompt engineering

## Execution — AI Integration
- [x] [aiService.js](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/src/services/aiService.js) — frontend API wrapper with mock fallback
- [x] [server/server.js](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/server/server.js) — Express proxy for OpenAI API
- [x] Mock client responses for each marker

## Execution — UI / Frontend
- [x] Dashboard — stat cards + radar chart + gap analysis + marker list
- [x] Training — step-by-step chat simulation interface
- [x] Details — accordion markers + transcript display
- [x] Components: radarChart, chatBubble, markerCard

## Verification
- [x] Dev server runs without errors (Vite + Express concurrently)
- [x] Dashboard renders correctly (radar, stats, markers)
- [x] Training simulation works end-to-end (client → user → evaluation)
- [x] Details view shows accordion with evaluations and transcript
- [x] No JS console errors
- [x] Write walkthrough
