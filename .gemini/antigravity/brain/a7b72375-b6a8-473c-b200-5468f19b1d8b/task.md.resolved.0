# Coach Training Simulator — Build Tasks

## Planning
- [x] Explore data structures ([sales-plan.json](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/sales-plan.json), [meeting-details.json](file:///home/epitech/technicalTest/coach-training-simulator/meeting-details.json))
- [x] Understand the README vision (passive feedback → active training)
- [/] Write implementation plan and get user approval

## Execution — Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Vite + React project
- [ ] Set up design system (CSS variables, fonts, base layout)
- [ ] Set up project structure (modules, components, services)

## Execution — Core Modules
- [ ] Sales Plan Loader — parse and structure markers
- [ ] Meeting Analyzer — extract performance gaps, missed/weak markers
- [ ] Training Engine — orchestrate simulation session flow
- [ ] Evaluation Layer — score user responses per marker

## Execution — AI Integration
- [ ] LLM integration service (OpenAI API)
- [ ] Client persona simulation (realistic responses)
- [ ] Response evaluation prompts

## Execution — UI / Frontend
- [ ] Dashboard — meeting performance overview + radar chart
- [ ] Training session — step-by-step simulation interface
- [ ] Marker detail — feedback, score, recommendations
- [ ] Session results — post-training summary

## Verification
- [ ] Dev server runs without errors
- [ ] All modules load data correctly
- [ ] UI is responsive and visually polished
- [ ] AI simulation flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Write walkthrough
